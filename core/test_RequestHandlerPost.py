```
Scenario 1: Testing successful POST request
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_post_request
  Description: This test is intended to verify that a successful POST request is handled correctly, and the appropriate response is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a RequestHandler object with a valid access token, and setup a mock server to return a successful status code and json response.
  Act: Invoke the post method on the RequestHandler object, passing a valid url, body, headers and query_params.
  Assert: Check that the returned response matches the mock server's response, and that a success log message is produced.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles successful POST requests as expected, which is crucial for the function's core functionality.

Scenario 2: Testing unsuccessful POST request
Details:
  TestName: test_unsuccessful_post_request
  Description: This test is intended to verify that an unsuccessful POST request is handled correctly, and an error log message is produced.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a RequestHandler object with a valid access token, and setup a mock server to return an unsuccessful status code and json error response.
  Act: Invoke the post method on the RequestHandler object, passing a valid url, body, headers and query_params.
  Assert: Check that an error log message is produced.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles unsuccessful POST requests as expected, which is important for error handling and debugging.

Scenario 3: Testing POST request with JSONDecodeError
Details:
  TestName: test_post_request_JSONDecodeError
  Description: This test is intended to verify that a POST request resulting in a JSONDecodeError is handled correctly, and the appropriate response is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a RequestHandler object with a valid access token, and setup a mock server to return a successful status code and a non-json response.
  Act: Invoke the post method on the RequestHandler object, passing a valid url, body, headers and query_params.
  Assert: Check that the returned response matches the mock server's response, and that a success log message is produced.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles POST requests that return non-json responses correctly, which is important for the function's robustness.

Scenario 4: Testing POST request with UnicodeDecodeError
Details:
  TestName: test_post_request_UnicodeDecodeError
  Description: This test is intended to verify that a POST request resulting in a UnicodeDecodeError is handled correctly, and the appropriate response is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a RequestHandler object with a valid access token, and setup a mock server to return a successful status code and a response that cannot be decoded to utf-8.
  Act: Invoke the post method on the RequestHandler object, passing a valid url, body, headers and query_params.
  Assert: Check that the returned response matches the mock server's response, and that a success log message is produced.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles POST requests that return responses that cannot be decoded to utf-8 correctly, which is important for the function's robustness.
  
Scenario 5: Testing POST request with Files
Details:
  TestName: test_post_request_with_files
  Description: This test is intended to verify that a POST request with files is handled correctly, and the appropriate response is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a RequestHandler object with a valid access token, setup a mock server to return a successful status code and a response, and prepare a file to be sent.
  Act: Invoke the post method on the RequestHandler object, passing a valid url, body, headers, query_params, and a file.
  Assert: Check that the returned response matches the mock server's response, and that a success log message is produced.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles POST requests with files correctly, which is important for the function's versatility.
