```
Scenario 1: Successful Async Patch
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_success
  Description: This test will validate that the async_patch function can successfully batch objects and patch them without any failures.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the AsyncHandler with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare a valid url and payload.
  Act: Call async_patch on the instance of AsyncHandler with the prepared url and payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False, indicating no batch failed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the async_patch function works as expected under normal conditions. It ensures that the function correctly batches the payload and sends async patch requests without any failures.

Scenario 2: Async Patch with Failed Batches
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_failed_batches
  Description: This test will validate that the async_patch function correctly returns True if any batch fails during the patch process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the AsyncHandler with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare a valid url and a payload that will cause patch requests to fail.
  Act: Call async_patch on the instance of AsyncHandler with the prepared url and payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True, indicating at least one batch failed.
Validation:
  This test verifies the async_patch function's ability to correctly handle failures during the patch process. It ensures that the function can correctly identify failed batches and return the appropriate result.

Scenario 3: Async Patch with Exceptions
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_exceptions
  Description: This test will validate that the async_patch function correctly handles exceptions and returns True when an exception is raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the AsyncHandler with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare a valid url and a payload that will cause an exception to be raised during the patch process.
  Act: Call async_patch on the instance of AsyncHandler with the prepared url and payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True, indicating an exception occurred.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the async_patch function is robust against unexpected errors. It ensures that the function can correctly handle exceptions and return the appropriate result.

Scenario 4: Async Patch with Empty Payload
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_empty_payload
  Description: This test will validate that the async_patch function can handle an empty payload correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the AsyncHandler with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare a valid url and an empty payload.
  Act: Call async_patch on the instance of AsyncHandler with the prepared url and empty payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False, indicating no batch failed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the async_patch function can correctly handle cases where the payload is empty. It ensures that the function does not fail or raise errors when there are no objects to batch and patch.
  
Scenario 5: Async Patch with Null Batch Size
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_null_batch_size
  Description: This test will validate that the async_patch function can handle a null batch size correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the AsyncHandler with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare a valid url, payload, and set batch size as None.
  Act: Call async_patch on the instance of AsyncHandler with the prepared url, payload, and batch size.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False, indicating no batch failed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the async_patch function can correctly handle cases where the batch size is not provided. It ensures that the function uses the default page size to batch the payload and does not fail or raise errors.
