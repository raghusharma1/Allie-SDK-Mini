Scenario 1: Testing the successful deletion of Alation Objects
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_deletion
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the Alation objects are successfully deleted, and the function returns False (indicating no failure).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the AsyncHandler with valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid delete API URL and payload.
  Act: Invoke the async_delete function with the prepared URL, payload, and a suitable batch size.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is False.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function executes the deletion correctly and does not return any failure. It confirms the function's ability to perform its primary task.

Scenario 2: Testing the deletion with an invalid URL
Details:
  TestName: test_deletion_with_invalid_url
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when an invalid URL is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the AsyncHandler with valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare an invalid delete API URL and a valid payload.
  Act: Invoke the async_delete function with the prepared URL, payload, and a suitable batch size.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is True (indicating a failure).
Validation:
  This test validates that the function handles an invalid URL correctly by returning a failure. It confirms the function's robustness against incorrect input.

Scenario 3: Testing the deletion with an empty payload
Details:
  TestName: test_deletion_with_empty_payload
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when an empty payload is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the AsyncHandler with valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid delete API URL and an empty payload.
  Act: Invoke the async_delete function with the prepared URL, payload, and a suitable batch size.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is True (indicating a failure).
Validation:
  This test validates that the function handles an empty payload correctly by returning a failure. It confirms the function's ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Testing the deletion with a large payload
Details:
  TestName: test_deletion_with_large_payload
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when a large payload is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the AsyncHandler with valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid delete API URL and a large payload.
  Act: Invoke the async_delete function with the prepared URL, payload, and a suitable batch size.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is False (indicating no failure).
Validation:
  This test validates that the function handles large payloads correctly by batching them and not returning a failure. It confirms the function's ability to handle varying payload sizes.

Scenario 5: Testing the deletion with a batch size larger than the payload
Details:
  TestName: test_deletion_with_large_batch_size
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the batch size is larger than the payload size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the AsyncHandler with valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid delete API URL and a payload. Set the batch size larger than the payload size.
  Act: Invoke the async_delete function with the prepared URL, payload, and the large batch size.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is False (indicating no failure).
Validation:
  This test validates that the function handles a batch size larger than the payload size correctly by not failing. It confirms the function's ability to handle varying batch sizes.
