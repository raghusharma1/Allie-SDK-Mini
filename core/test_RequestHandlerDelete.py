```plaintext
Scenario 1: Successful DELETE request with a body in dictionary format
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_request_dict_body
  Description: Test to verify that the delete function successfully handles a DELETE request when the body is in dictionary format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the RequestHandler object with valid session, host, and access_token. Prepare a valid API endpoint and a body in dictionary format.
  Act: Call the delete function with the prepared API endpoint and body.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected response. The status code should be in SUCCESS_CODES.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the delete function correctly prepares and sends a DELETE request when the body is in dictionary format, and successfully handles the response.

Scenario 2: Successful DELETE request with a body in list format
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_request_list_body
  Description: Test to verify that the delete function successfully handles a DELETE request when the body is in list format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the RequestHandler object with valid session, host, and access_token. Prepare a valid API endpoint and a body in list format.
  Act: Call the delete function with the prepared API endpoint and body.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected response. The status code should be in SUCCESS_CODES.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the delete function correctly prepares and sends a DELETE request when the body is in list format, and successfully handles the response.

Scenario 3: Unsuccessful DELETE request with error status code
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_request_error_status_code
  Description: Test to verify that the delete function correctly handles an error status code returned from a DELETE request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the RequestHandler object with valid session, host, and access_token. Prepare a valid API endpoint and a body that will cause the server to return an error status code.
  Act: Call the delete function with the prepared API endpoint and body.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly logs the error and does not return a successful response.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the delete function correctly handles error status codes returned from a DELETE request, logs the error, and does not return a successful response.

Scenario 4: DELETE request with malformed JSON response body
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_request_malformed_json
  Description: Test to verify that the delete function correctly handles a DELETE request that returns a response with a malformed JSON body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the RequestHandler object with valid session, host, and access_token. Prepare a valid API endpoint and a body that will cause the server to return a response with a malformed JSON body.
  Act: Call the delete function with the prepared API endpoint and body.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly catches the JSONDecodeError and attempts to decode the content as a UTF-8 string.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the delete function correctly handles a DELETE request that returns a response with a malformed JSON body by catching the JSONDecodeError and attempting to decode the content as a UTF-8 string.

Scenario 5: DELETE request with non-UTF-8 encoded response body
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_request_non_utf8_encoded_body
  Description: Test to verify that the delete function correctly handles a DELETE request that returns a response with a non-UTF-8 encoded body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the RequestHandler object with valid session, host, and access_token. Prepare a valid API endpoint and a body that will cause the server to return a response with a non-UTF-8 encoded body.
  Act: Call the delete function with the prepared API endpoint and body.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly catches the UnicodeDecodeError and returns the content as it is.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the delete function correctly handles a DELETE request that returns a response with a non-UTF-8 encoded body by catching the UnicodeDecodeError and returning the content as it is.
