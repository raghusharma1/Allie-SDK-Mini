Scenario 1: Successful Deletion with Valid URL and Payload
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_deletion
  Description: This test verifies that the async_delete_dict_payload function successfully deletes the Alation Objects when provided with a valid URL and payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of AsyncHandler with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL and payload.
  Act: Invoke async_delete_dict_payload function with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: The function should return None, indicating that the deletion job was successful.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function works as expected with valid inputs. The successful deletion of Alation Objects is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system.

Scenario 2: Deletion Failure with Invalid URL
Details:
  TestName: test_deletion_failure_invalid_url
  Description: This test verifies that the async_delete_dict_payload function returns True when provided with an invalid URL.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of AsyncHandler with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare an invalid URL and a valid payload.
  Act: Invoke async_delete_dict_payload function with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating that the deletion job failed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles invalid URLs. The function must return an error when the deletion job fails to maintain system stability.

Scenario 3: Deletion Failure with Empty Payload
Details:
  TestName: test_deletion_failure_empty_payload
  Description: This test verifies that the async_delete_dict_payload function returns True when provided with an empty payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of AsyncHandler with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL and an empty payload.
  Act: Invoke async_delete_dict_payload function with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating that the deletion job failed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles empty payloads. The function must return an error when the deletion job fails to prevent unintended deletions.

Scenario 4: Deletion Failure with None Payload
Details:
  TestName: test_deletion_failure_none_payload
  Description: This test verifies that the async_delete_dict_payload function returns True when provided with a None payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of AsyncHandler with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL and a None payload.
  Act: Invoke async_delete_dict_payload function with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating that the deletion job failed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles None payloads. The function must return an error when the deletion job fails to prevent unintended deletions.
