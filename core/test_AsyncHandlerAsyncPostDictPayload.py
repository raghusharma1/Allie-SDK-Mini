Scenario 1: Successful Async Job Execution
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_dict_payload_successful_execution
  Description: This test verifies that the function async_post_dict_payload properly executes an Async job when it receives a valid URL and payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the AsyncHandler object with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL and payload.
  Act: Call the async_post_dict_payload method with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns None, indicating the Async job has not failed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can properly execute an Async job. Successful Async job execution is crucial for the functionality of the system as it allows for efficient handling of tasks.

Scenario 2: Failed Async Job Execution
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_dict_payload_failed_execution
  Description: This test verifies that the function async_post_dict_payload returns True when the Async job fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the AsyncHandler object with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL and payload that will cause the Async job to fail.
  Act: Call the async_post_dict_payload method with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True, indicating the Async job has failed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles failed Async jobs. It's crucial for the system to be aware of failed jobs to ensure data integrity and system reliability.

Scenario 3: Invalid URL Passed
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_dict_payload_invalid_url
  Description: This test verifies that the function async_post_dict_payload handles an invalid URL properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the AsyncHandler object with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare an invalid URL and a valid payload.
  Act: Call the async_post_dict_payload method with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True, indicating the Async job has failed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle improper input without causing unexpected errors. Proper error handling is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of the system.

Scenario 4: Empty Payload Passed
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_dict_payload_empty_payload
  Description: This test verifies that the function async_post_dict_payload handles an empty payload properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the AsyncHandler object with a valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL and an empty payload.
  Act: Call the async_post_dict_payload method with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True, indicating the Async job has failed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle improper input without causing unexpected errors. Proper error handling is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of the system.
