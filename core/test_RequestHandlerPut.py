Scenario 1: Successful PUT Request with Dictionary Body
Details:
  TestName: test_put_request_with_dict_body
  Description: This test verifies that the put method can successfully send a PUT request when the body is a dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a RequestHandler instance, and prepare a URL, a dictionary body, and query parameters.
  Act: Invoke the put method with the URL, dictionary body and query parameters.
  Assert: Check that the response data returned by the function matches the expected data.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the put method can handle dictionary bodies, which is a common data type for REST API bodies.

Scenario 2: Successful PUT Request with List Body
Details:
  TestName: test_put_request_with_list_body
  Description: This test verifies that the put method can successfully send a PUT request when the body is a list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a RequestHandler instance, and prepare a URL, a list body, and query parameters.
  Act: Invoke the put method with the URL, list body and query parameters.
  Assert: Check that the response data returned by the function matches the expected data.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the put method can handle list bodies, which is another common data type for REST API bodies.

Scenario 3: PUT Request with Invalid URL
Details:
  TestName: test_put_request_with_invalid_url
  Description: This test verifies that the put method can handle an invalid URL and logs the appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a RequestHandler instance, and prepare an invalid URL, a body, and query parameters.
  Act: Invoke the put method with the invalid URL, body and query parameters.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate error is logged.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the put method gracefully handles invalid URLs, which is a likely error scenario.

Scenario 4: PUT Request with Non-JSON Response
Details:
  TestName: test_put_request_with_non_json_response
  Description: This test verifies that the put method can handle a non-JSON response and correctly decode the response content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a RequestHandler instance, and prepare a URL, a body, and query parameters. Mock the server response to return non-JSON content.
  Act: Invoke the put method with the URL, body and query parameters.
  Assert: Check that the response data returned by the function matches the expected data.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the put method can correctly handle non-JSON responses, which is a possible scenario in real-world applications.

Scenario 5: PUT Request with No Query Parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_put_request_with_no_query_params
  Description: This test verifies that the put method can successfully send a PUT request when no query parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a RequestHandler instance, and prepare a URL and a body.
  Act: Invoke the put method with the URL and body.
  Assert: Check that the response data returned by the function matches the expected data.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the put method can handle requests without query parameters, which is a common use case.
