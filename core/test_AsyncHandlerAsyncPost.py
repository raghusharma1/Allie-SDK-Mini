Scenario 1: Successful Async Post
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_success
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful execution of the async_post method, where all batches are processed successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the test environment by creating a valid instance of AsyncHandler with access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL, payload, and batch_size.
  Act: Invoke the async_post method with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is None, indicating that no batch failed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the async_post method works as expected under normal conditions and successfully processes all batches.

Scenario 2: Async Post with failed batches
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_failed_batches
  Description: This test is intended to verify the async_post method's behavior when some batches fail to process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the test environment by creating a valid instance of AsyncHandler with access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL, payload, and batch_size that would cause some batches to fail.
  Act: Invoke the async_post method with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is True, indicating that at least one batch failed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the async_post method correctly handles failed batches and returns the expected result.

Scenario 3: Async Post with exception in batch processing
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_exception
  Description: This test is intended to verify the async_post method's behavior when an exception occurs during batch processing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the test environment by creating a valid instance of AsyncHandler with access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL, payload, and batch_size that would cause an exception during batch processing.
  Act: Invoke the async_post method with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is True, indicating that an exception occurred during batch processing.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the async_post method correctly handles exceptions during batch processing and returns the expected result.

Scenario 4: Async Post with empty payload
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_empty_payload
  Description: This test is intended to verify the async_post method's behavior when the payload is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the test environment by creating a valid instance of AsyncHandler with access_token, session, and host. Prepare a valid URL and an empty payload.
  Act: Invoke the async_post method with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is None, indicating that no batch failed (since there were no batches to process).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the async_post method correctly handles an empty payload and returns the expected result.

Scenario 5: Async Post with invalid URL
Details:
  TestName: test_async_post_invalid_url
  Description: This test is intended to verify the async_post method's behavior when the URL is invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the test environment by creating a valid instance of AsyncHandler with access_token, session, and host. Prepare an invalid URL and a valid payload.
  Act: Invoke the async_post method with prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is True, indicating that an exception occurred during batch processing (due to the invalid URL).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the async_post method correctly handles an invalid URL and returns the expected result.
