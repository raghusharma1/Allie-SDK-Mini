Scenario 3: Test API Get Request with Pagination
Details:
  TestName: test_api_get_with_pagination
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get function can successfully handle paginated results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a RequestHandler object with a valid session, host, and access_token. Prepare a valid URL and query parameters that will result in paginated results.
  Act: Invoke the get function with the prepared URL and query parameters, and with pagination set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned items are not None and that all pages of results are returned.
Validation:
  The get function should be able to handle paginated results. All pages of results should be returned and match the expected results based on the given URL and query parameters.
