```
Scenario 1: Successful Async PUT
Details:
  TestName: test_async_put_success
  Description: This test will validate that the async_put function can successfully batch objects and perform an async PUT operation without any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will initialize an AsyncHandler object with a valid access token, session, and host. We will also prepare a list of dummy payload data and a valid URL.
  Act: Invoke the async_put function with the URL, payload, and a defined batch size.
  Assert: The function should return False indicating successful operation.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it validates the fundamental functionality of async_put function. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and the business requirement of performing async PUT operations.

Scenario 2: Async PUT with Empty Payload
Details:
  TestName: test_async_put_empty_payload
  Description: This test will verify the behavior of the async_put function when the payload is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an AsyncHandler object with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare an empty payload list and a valid URL.
  Act: Invoke the async_put function with the URL and empty payload.
  Assert: The function should return False as there is no data to process.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases of empty payloads without causing errors or undesired behaviors.

Scenario 3: Async PUT with Invalid URL
Details:
  TestName: test_async_put_invalid_url
  Description: This test will validate the async_put function's behavior when provided with an invalid URL.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an AsyncHandler object with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare a list of dummy payload data and an invalid URL.
  Act: Invoke the async_put function with the invalid URL and payload.
  Assert: The function should return True indicating a failure in the PUT operation.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks the function's robustness and its ability to handle incorrect inputs gracefully.

Scenario 4: Async PUT Failure due to Exception
Details:
  TestName: test_async_put_exception
  Description: This test will verify the async_put function's behavior when an exception occurs during the PUT operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an AsyncHandler object with a valid access token, session, and host. Prepare a list of dummy payload data and a valid URL. Mock the put method to throw an exception.
  Act: Invoke the async_put function with the URL and payload.
  Assert: The function should return True indicating a failure in the PUT operation.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle exceptions gracefully and return an appropriate failure indicator.
