Scenario 1: Testing the function with a data class that has all fields non-empty
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_params_dict_all_fields_non_empty
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly generates a dictionary when all fields of the data class are non-empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a data class with some fields and initialize an object of this class with all fields non-empty.
  Act: Call the function generate_params_dict on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned dictionary has the same number of items as the data class and each key-value pair matches the corresponding field-value pair in the data class.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the normal case when all fields are non-empty. The expected result is derived from the specifications of the function, which states that it should generate a dictionary from the fields of the data class.

Scenario 2: Testing the function with a data class that has some fields empty
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_params_dict_some_fields_empty
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly generates a dictionary when some fields of the data class are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a data class with some fields and initialize an object of this class with some fields empty.
  Act: Call the function generate_params_dict on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned dictionary only includes non-empty fields and each key-value pair matches the corresponding field-value pair in the data class.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the case when some fields are empty. It is important because the function should ignore empty fields when generating the dictionary.

Scenario 3: Testing the function with a data class that has all fields empty
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_params_dict_all_fields_empty
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly generates an empty dictionary when all fields of the data class are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a data class with some fields and initialize an object of this class with all fields empty.
  Act: Call the function generate_params_dict on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned dictionary is empty.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the edge case when all fields are empty. The expected result is derived from the specifications of the function, which states that it should ignore empty fields.

Scenario 4: Testing the function with a data class that has no fields
Details:
  TestName: test_generate_params_dict_no_fields
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly generates an empty dictionary when the data class has no fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a data class with no fields and initialize an object of this class.
  Act: Call the function generate_params_dict on the created object.
  Assert: Check that the returned dictionary is empty.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the edge case when there are no fields in the data class. The expected result is derived from the specifications of the function, which states that it should return an empty dictionary if there are no fields.
