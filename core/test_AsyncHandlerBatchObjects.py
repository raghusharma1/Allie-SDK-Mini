Scenario 1: Test the default batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_default_batch_size
  Description: This test verifies that when no batch size is provided, the function uses the default page size to create the batches.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects and the RequestHandler object with the default page size.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with the list of objects and without specifying a batch size.
  Assert: Check that the returned list of batches has the expected size, which should match the default page size.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly uses the default page size when no batch size is provided, which is a key part of its specifications.

Scenario 2: Test a specified batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_specified_batch_size
  Description: This test verifies that when a batch size is provided, the function uses this size to create the batches.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects and the RequestHandler object.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with the list of objects and a specific batch size.
  Assert: Check that the returned list of batches has the expected size, which should match the provided batch size.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly uses a provided batch size, which is a key part of its specifications.

Scenario 3: Test an empty list of objects
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_objects_list
  Description: This test verifies that when an empty list is provided, the function returns an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list of objects and the RequestHandler object.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with the empty list of objects.
  Assert: Check that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles an empty list, which is a possible edge case in its input.

Scenario 4: Test a list of objects smaller than the batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_objects_list_smaller_than_batch_size
  Description: This test verifies that when the list of objects is smaller than the batch size, the function returns a single batch with all objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects smaller than the default page size and the RequestHandler object.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with the list of objects.
  Assert: Check that the returned list contains a single batch with all objects.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles a list of objects smaller than the batch size, which is a possible edge case in its input.

Scenario 5: Test a list of objects larger than the batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_objects_list_larger_than_batch_size
  Description: This test verifies that when the list of objects is larger than the batch size, the function correctly splits the objects into multiple batches.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects larger than the default page size and the RequestHandler object.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with the list of objects.
  Assert: Check that the returned list contains multiple batches, each of size equal to or smaller than the batch size.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly splits a large list of objects into batches, which is a key part of its specifications.
