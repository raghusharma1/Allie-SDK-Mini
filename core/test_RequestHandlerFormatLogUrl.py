Scenario 1: Verify URL formatting with only path component
Details:
  TestName: test_format_log_url_with_only_path
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly formats the URL when it contains only the path component.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a valid session, host, access_token and page_size.
  Act: Invoke _format_log_url with a URL containing only the path component.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the same URL as it only contains the path component. This will be checked by comparing the function's output with the expected URL.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the fundamental functionality of the _format_log_url method. It verifies that the function correctly handles the simplest case of a URL with only a path component.

Scenario 2: Verify URL formatting with path and query components
Details:
  TestName: test_format_log_url_with_path_and_query
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly formats the URL when it contains both path and query components.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a valid session, host, access_token and page_size.
  Act: Invoke _format_log_url with a URL containing both path and query components.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the URL with both the path and query components. This will be checked by comparing the function's output with the expected URL.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle more complex URLs. It verifies that the function correctly formats URLs containing both path and query components.

Scenario 3: Verify URL formatting with no path component
Details:
  TestName: test_format_log_url_with_no_path
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles an URL with no path component.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a valid session, host, access_token and page_size.
  Act: Invoke _format_log_url with a URL containing no path component.
  Assert: The expected outcome is an empty string as there is no path component in the URL. This will be checked by comparing the function's output with the expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to handle edge cases. It verifies that the function correctly handles URLs with no path component.

Scenario 4: Verify URL formatting with empty URL
Details:
  TestName: test_format_log_url_with_empty_url
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles an empty URL.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a valid session, host, access_token and page_size.
  Act: Invoke _format_log_url with an empty URL.
  Assert: The expected outcome is an empty string as the URL is empty. This will be checked by comparing the function's output with the expected result.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases. It confirms that the function correctly handles an empty URL.
