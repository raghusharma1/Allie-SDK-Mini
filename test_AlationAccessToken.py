Scenario 1: Setting a valid access token
Details:
  TestName: test_access_token_setting_valid_token
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly sets a valid access token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the Alation object with all required parameters. Generate a valid access token for the test.
  Act: Invoke the access_token function with the valid access token as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the access token has been correctly set by comparing the value of self._access_token with the valid token used as input.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of setting a valid access token. The expected result is that the access token is correctly set, which is fundamental to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Setting an empty access token
Details:
  TestName: test_access_token_setting_empty_token
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly handles an empty access token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the Alation object with all required parameters.
  Act: Invoke the access_token function with an empty string as the access token parameter.
  Assert: Check if the access token has been correctly set to an empty string by comparing the value of self._access_token with an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks how the function handles empty access tokens. The expected result is that the access token is set to an empty string, which aligns with Python's handling of empty strings and is consistent with the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Resetting an existing access token
Details:
  TestName: test_access_token_resetting_existing_token
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly resets an existing access token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the Alation object with all required parameters. Set a valid access token. Generate a new valid access token for the test.
  Act: Invoke the access_token function with the new valid access token as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the access token has been correctly reset by comparing the value of self._access_token with the new valid token used as input.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's ability to reset an existing access token. The expected result is that the access token is correctly reset, which is critical for maintaining secure and up-to-date access credentials in line with the function's specifications and business requirements.
